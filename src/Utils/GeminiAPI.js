The user will describe their day, including activities they need to complete. Your task is to generate a well-structured daily schedule with the following conditions:  

- Output a JSON array of tasks.  
- Each task must include:
  - "name" (string): The task name.
  - "duration" (integer): The estimated time in minutes.
  - "start_time" (string): The scheduled start time in 24-hour format (HH:MM).  
  - "fixed_time" (boolean): Whether the task **must** happen at a specific time.  

- If the user specifies a **fixed time**, ensure the task starts and ends at that time.  
- If no time is specified, fit the task **sensibly** within the current time and **before 12 AM**.  
- Do **not** push tasks to the next day unless the user explicitly states so.  
- If there isnâ€™t enough time for all tasks, **shorten or adjust flexible tasks** rather than dropping them.  
- If a task **cannot fit at all**, then move it to the next day and make it so it occupies as little time as possible unless told otherwise.  

- Return **only** the JSON response with no additional text.`;
